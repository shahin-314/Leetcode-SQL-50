## 🧠 Question Understanding

We have an **Employee** table:

| employee_id | department_id | primary_flag |
| ----------- | ------------- | ------------ |
| 1           | 1             | N            |
| 2           | 1             | Y            |
| 2           | 2             | N            |
| 3           | 3             | N            |
| 4           | 2             | N            |
| 4           | 3             | Y            |
| 4           | 4             | N            |

### ✅ What It Means

* Each **employee** can belong to **multiple departments**.
* Among those departments, one may be marked `'Y'` (primary department).
* If an employee belongs to **only one department**, even if it is marked `'N'`, that is automatically their primary department.

---

### 🎯 Goal

We need to return **each employee’s primary department**.

So our output should be:

| employee_id | department_id |
| ----------- | ------------- |
| 1           | 1             |
| 2           | 1             |
| 3           | 3             |
| 4           | 3             |

## 🧩 Step-by-Step Reasoning

Let’s break the logic into two simple cases 👇

| Case  | Condition                         | What to do                                |
| ----- | --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **1** | Employee has only 1 department    | That single department is primary         |
| **2** | Employee has multiple departments | Select the one where `primary_flag = 'Y'` |

---

## 💻 SQL Solution

Here’s the clean and correct query:

```sql
SELECT 
    employee_id,
    department_id
FROM Employee
WHERE primary_flag = 'Y'
   OR employee_id IN (
       SELECT employee_id
       FROM Employee
       GROUP BY employee_id
       HAVING COUNT(department_id) = 1
   );
```

---

## 🔍 Step-by-Step Explanation

### 🧩 Step 1: Find employees who have only one department

```sql
SELECT employee_id
FROM Employee
GROUP BY employee_id
HAVING COUNT(department_id) = 1;
```

👉 This gives you employees who belong to exactly **one department**.
In our example, employee `1` and `3` fall into this case.

| employee_id |
| ----------- |
| 1           |
| 3           |

---

### 🧩 Step 2: Select employees whose department is marked as `'Y'`

```sql
SELECT employee_id, department_id
FROM Employee
WHERE primary_flag = 'Y';
```

👉 This gives you employees who have explicitly set a primary department.

| employee_id | department_id |
| ----------- | ------------- |
| 2           | 1             |
| 4           | 3             |

---

### 🧩 Step 3: Combine both using `OR`

```sql
SELECT 
    employee_id,
    department_id
FROM Employee
WHERE primary_flag = 'Y'
   OR employee_id IN (
       SELECT employee_id
       FROM Employee
       GROUP BY employee_id
       HAVING COUNT(department_id) = 1
   );
```

✅ This ensures:

* You include employees with `'Y'` flag (multi-department case),
* And employees with only one department (single-department case).

## 🧾 Final Output

| employee_id | department_id |
| ----------- | ------------- |
| 1           | 1             |
| 2           | 1             |
| 3           | 3             |
| 4           | 3             |

## 💡 Quick Summary

| Concept                           | Meaning                                                |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `GROUP BY employee_id`            | Groups all rows for each employee                      |
| `HAVING COUNT(department_id) = 1` | Finds employees with exactly one department            |
| `primary_flag = 'Y'`              | Picks employees who explicitly marked a primary dept   |
| `OR`                              | Combines both single-department and primary-flag cases |

Would you like me to visually show how the SQL filters rows step-by-step (with table snapshots after each condition)?
That’ll make the flow crystal clear visually 👀
